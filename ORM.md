The full name of ORM is Object-Relational Mapping.

It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systems (like object-oriented programming languages and relational databases). ORM allows developers to interact with a database using the syntax and constructs of their programming language, instead of writing raw SQL queries. Popular ORM frameworks include:

SQLAlchemy (Python)
Django ORM (Python)
Hibernate (Java)
Entity Framework (.NET)
Active Record (Ruby on Rails)
